# Spotify-Tracks_DA

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics using Spotify Web API, Python, and MySQL. The system fetches real-time Spotify track metadata, processes it using Python, stores it in a relational database, and performs structured SQL analysis to uncover insights about track popularity and duration.
The project highlights practical skills in API integration, data extraction, database design, SQL querying, and data visualization, making it suitable for data analyst and backend-oriented roles.
